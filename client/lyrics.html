			<h2 class="font_2"><span><br>Snowflakes</span></h2>
			<br>
			<p>Rationalize, little white lies, like snowflakes they do fall</p>
			<p>Each one seems so small, a cotton ball, but together they grow tall</p>
			<p>One last time and then it&rsquo;s over, just one more dirty dance</p>
			<p>But you told yourself that yesterday, it&rsquo;s time to take a stance</p>
			<p>But you&rsquo;re in a trance</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Condemn your actions in the light of day, then engage in them at night</p>
			<p>The darkness distorts everything, then rears its ugly face in the morning light</p>
			<p>You know this struggle is ancient, yes it&rsquo;s tired and tried and trite</p>
			<p>And your behavior used to make your heart sag and your throat gag in hindsight</p>
			<p>But now maybe it&rsquo;s right?</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Because desire flicked off the switch in your brain that tells you what is wrong</p>
			<p>And it&rsquo;s spoon fed by society till it grows big and tall and strong</p>
			<p>And why not do what is easy rather than waiting so unnaturally long?</p>
			<p>Hop the fences, please the senses, the join the endless throng</p>
			<p>Of the tired pawns</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Yes snow it can be glorious, coating earth with a celestial white</p>
			<p>It trumps the icy cold, its sullen ally, its bitter, burning bite</p>
			<p>But eventually it always melts and reveals the damp dirt underneath</p>
			<p>The world turns and the cold returns and bares its piercing, icy teeth</p>
			<p>And you realize something of yours is missing but you yourself are the thief</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Follow me into the forest&rdquo;</p>

			<p>As a fleeting sparkle catches her eyes</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Push with me through tangled brush</p>
			<p>The thorny limbs wrestle our feet</p>
			<p>Take me to the fields so lush</p>
			<p>Where mystery and magic meet</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Will the monsters of the forest</p>
			<p>Seek us in the cover of the dark</p>
			<p>When the screeching of the bands of bats</p>
			<p>Replaces the singing of the meadowlarks</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The lightning bugs will be our guide</p>
			<p>And take us to the queen of light</p>
			<p>Who will point up at the stars above</p>
			<p>And proclaim that she still rules the night</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We will try to find the path home</p>
			<p>The wolf&rsquo;s howl ever near and shrill</p>
			<p>But all directions will lead ahead</p>
			<p>Deeper into the forest still</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Kiss me now before we&rsquo;re found</p>
			<p>Against this ancient oaken tree</p>
			<p>Is it too dark outside to daydream?</p>
			<p>Rescue me from this reverie</p>

			<p>Why am I wasting the day counting down the minutes till I sleep?</p>
			<p>Cause most of us just waste away. In a hundred years who will remember me?</p>
			<p>Why don&rsquo;t we appreciate the time that we have till it&rsquo;s gone?</p>
			<p>Why does the swan wait so long to sing its futile song?</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Planning for the future and pondering about the concrete past.</p>
			<p>Why don&rsquo;t we focus on now, the things that matter never really last.</p>
			<p>You&rsquo;ll never achieve anything if you are so scared of being wrong.</p>
			<p>Why does the swan wait so long to sing its futile song?</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting all my life to make something I can call my won.</p>
			<p>Forget about the family, forget about the car, the job, the home.</p>
			<p>But I keep pushing it off and God I know I&rsquo;ve waited far too long.</p>
			<p>Why does the swan wait so long to sing its futile song?</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It is all just a foolish dream?</p>
			<p>Should I do my time behind a screen?</p>
			<p>Cause who is really lucky enough</p>
			<p>To spend their time doing what they really love?</p>
			<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me to just give in</p>
			<p>I think that&rsquo;s a waste, I think that&rsquo;s a cardinal sin</p>
			<p>To spend your life doing what you hate</p>
			<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a bigger mistake</p>

			<p>We lives our lives in ignorance, never accepting our dismal fate.</p>

			<p>My time is come and all I want is more time by your side.</p>
			<p>To patch up all the wreckage and embrace what we&rsquo;ve denied.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>I don&rsquo;t want to die. I don&rsquo;t want to die. I don&rsquo;t want to die all alone.</p>
			<p>The darkness will subside and there will be a light and I will see that I, I&rsquo;m coming home.</p>
			<p>Will my memories come for the ride? Will I see you on the other side?</p>
			<p>Please hold me tight and never let me go.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>My fits of rage were just a stage, a way for me to cope.</p>
			<p>But again of course my voice is hoarse from an extinguished hope.</p>
			<p>On our drive away from life, away from fairytale dreams</p>
			<p>You hold me, together we cry, our hearts split at the seams.</p>
			<p>But we all complete.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t need to look our best or save the damsel in distress</p>
			<p>We can be heroes you and I</p>

			<p>I want to break the rules</p>
			<p>And play all the world for fools</p>
			<p>In money that&rsquo;ll make you drool</p>
			<p>I will take a golden bath</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>No longer care &lsquo;bout the art</p>
			<p>I just want to top the charts</p>

			<p>Just to get my autograph</p>

			<p>We can be heroes you and I</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;ll look so star-struck, like they can&rsquo;t believe their luck</p>
			<p>We can be heroes you and I</p>

			<br>
			<p>At the most unexpected times</p>
			<p>I feel the sadness wash over me</p>
			<p>Gut me, lonely, angry, ashamed</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>I look back at memories that were once happy</p>
			<p>But have soured over time, and leave me sick with envy</p>
			<p>For another me, in another galaxy, with different choices, a novel history, a new name</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>And I think of you and how you never gave up and I never gave in</p>
			<p>And how you still hold a place in my heart, although you try to keep yourself apart</p>
			<p>From me, and I feel guilty and empty and lost</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>And sometimes I wish I could just be happy</p>
			<p>Forget all my worries, all my insecurities</p>
			<p>And poison myself till I become someone else</p>
			<p>And have fun just like everyone else</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Because I used to tell myself I was different, special, unique</p>
			<p>But it turns out that every day</p>
			<p>I become more and more the same</p>
			<p>We are all animals and all my ideal morality, in its varnished totality</p>
			<p>Is foolish, a waste, a mistake</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>What&rsquo;s the use in being an iconoclast?</p>
			<p>When nothing I believe ever lasts?</p>
			<p>Why carve out a song like it&rsquo;s your newborn child?</p>
			<p>When a song that could have been written by that same child tops the charts?</p>
			<p>After all, no matter the melody, the lyrics, the chords, it&rsquo;s all art</p>
			<p>And who&rsquo;s to say that this is better than that?</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s all the same anyways, one dimensional, flat</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>All these thoughts they clog up my brain</p>
			<p>But I repress and suppress them to keep myself sane</p>
			<p>People want your honest opinion, or at least so they claim</p>
			<p>But they really want you to affirm their own, we are all selfish and vane</p>
			<p>We are not concerned with others pain</p>
			<p>And definitely not their ideas</p>
