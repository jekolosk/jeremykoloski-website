		<h2 class="font_2"><span><br>Snowflakes</span></h2>
		<br>
		<p>Rationalize, little white lies, like snowflakes they do fall</p>
		<p>Each one seems so small, a cotton ball, but together they grow tall</p>
		<p>One last time and then it&rsquo;s over, just one more dirty dance</p>
		<p>But you told yourself that yesterday, it&rsquo;s time to take a stance</p>
		<p>But you&rsquo;re in a trance</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Condemn your actions in the light of day, then engage in them at night</p>
		<p>The darkness distorts everything, then rears its ugly face in the morning light</p>
		<p>You know this struggle is ancient, yes it&rsquo;s tired and tried and trite</p>
		<p>And your behavior used to make your heart sag and your throat gag in hindsight</p>
		<p>But now maybe it&rsquo;s right?</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Because desire flicked off the switch in your brain that tells you what is wrong</p>
		<p>And it&rsquo;s spoon fed by society till it grows big and tall and strong</p>
		<p>And why not do what is easy rather than waiting so unnaturally long?</p>
		<p>Hop the fences, please the senses, the join the endless throng</p>
		<p>Of the tired pawns</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Yes snow it can be glorious, coating earth with a celestial white</p>
		<p>It trumps the icy cold, its sullen ally, its bitter, burning bite</p>
		<p>But eventually it always melts and reveals the damp dirt underneath</p>
		<p>The world turns and the cold returns and bares its piercing, icy teeth</p>
		<p>And you realize something of yours is missing but you yourself are the thief</p>

		<h2 class="font_2"><span><br>Follow Me</span></h2>
		<br>
		<p>&ldquo;Follow me into the forest&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Dimly lit by fireflies</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Follow me&rdquo; she softly whispers</p>
		<p>As a fleeting sparkle catches her eyes</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Push with me through tangled brush</p>
		<p>The thorny limbs wrestle our feet</p>
		<p>Take me to the fields so lush</p>
		<p>Where mystery and magic meet</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Will the monsters of the forest</p>
		<p>Seek us in the cover of the dark</p>
		<p>When the screeching of the bands of bats</p>
		<p>Replaces the singing of the meadowlarks</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The lightning bugs will be our guide</p>
		<p>And take us to the queen of light</p>
		<p>Who will point up at the stars above</p>
		<p>And proclaim that she still rules the night</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>We will try to find the path home</p>
		<p>The wolf&rsquo;s howl ever near and shrill</p>
		<p>But all directions will lead ahead</p>
		<p>Deeper into the forest still</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Kiss me now before we&rsquo;re found</p>
		<p>Against this ancient oaken tree</p>
		<p>Is it too dark outside to daydream?</p>
		<p>Rescue me from this reverie</p>

		<h2 class="font_2"><span><br>Swan Song</span></h2>
		<br>
		<p>Why am I wasting the day counting down the minutes till I sleep?</p>
		<p>Cause most of us just waste away. In a hundred years who will remember me?</p>
		<p>Why don&rsquo;t we appreciate the time that we have till it&rsquo;s gone?</p>
		<p>Why does the swan wait so long to sing its futile song?</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Planning for the future and pondering about the concrete past.</p>
		<p>Why don&rsquo;t we focus on now, the things that matter never really last.</p>
		<p>You&rsquo;ll never achieve anything if you are so scared of being wrong.</p>
		<p>Why does the swan wait so long to sing its futile song?</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting all my life to make something I can call my won.</p>
		<p>Forget about the family, forget about the car, the job, the home.</p>
		<p>But I keep pushing it off and God I know I&rsquo;ve waited far too long.</p>
		<p>Why does the swan wait so long to sing its futile song?</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It is all just a foolish dream?</p>
		<p>Should I do my time behind a screen?</p>
		<p>Cause who is really lucky enough</p>
		<p>To spend their time doing what they really love?</p>
		<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me to just give in</p>
		<p>I think that&rsquo;s a waste, I think that&rsquo;s a cardinal sin</p>
		<p>To spend your life doing what you hate</p>
		<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a bigger mistake</p>
