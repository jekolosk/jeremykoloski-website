		<p>Hey!</p>
		<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed some of my work, I definitely enjoyed creating it!</p>
		<p>In case you were curious, I&rsquo;ll tell you a bit about me.</p>
		<p>Creative output has always been my passion. Growing up, I was always searching for new avenues of creative expression, whether it be my own work or that of others. I would wander around the house and whisper spontaneous melodies into my handheld recorder, write stories into notebooks, draw onto printer paper, etc. When I was 16, I began to play around with the keyboard at home. I would watch YouTube tutorials of my favorite songs and copy what I saw. Slowly, I began to get the hang of it, and before long I was composing my own pieces and learning songs by ear (learning from tutorials now felt like cheating).&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Fast forward a few years. Coming into college as an undecided major, I was full of passions and hobbies but was no closer to figuring out what I wanted to do with my life.&nbsp; I decided to give computer science a shot. A few years later I did a summer program at Brandeis University in which I learned the basics of web development. I discovered that programming could be a powerful tool for creative output as well, and became fascinated with front end development.</p>
		<p>Last summer, I taught myself some of the Adobe Suite from YouTube tutorials and explored its palette excitedly. I have also always loved storytelling, and wrote two short stories for my creative writing class last semester.</p>
		<p>This website is a small taste of my creative output over the years. I still have many pieces to compose, stories to write, pictures to take, drawing to draw, and websites to create.</p>
		<p>My dream is to put my passion for creative output to use by doing something in a related field for a living.</p>
